## Focus on the binding sites of proteins

Witness the common parts at which quite different drugs bind.

## Allosteric Control

    molecule A + Protein -> Protein conformation changed -> molecule B bind

## Structue explain evolution

**Structure tends not to change mych over evolutionary time, whereas the sequence can change a lot.** Things which have diverged quite a long way may have very different sequences, which are almost impossible to detect by sequence search methods. But the structures will have remained the same because it is a structure that is key for performing the function.

During the evolutionary time, key domains occurs over and over again. Evolution keeps the things work maybe adds things on to modify that function.

## Problems caused by Point Mutations

- Truncation: Mutations cause stop codon in the middle of nucleic acid sequences.

- Misfolding: Mutations disrupt protein folding so it does not achiece its proper 3D structure.

- Mutations at the catalystic residue/ metal binding site/ substrate binding site.

- Mutations interupt protein-protein interaction/ protein-DNA interaction.

Predict exact changes from mutation is difficult, but got a known disease and a known variant can suggest the mechanism.
