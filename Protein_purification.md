# Protein Purification

## Before Purification

**To investivate:**

1. Protein size (MW)
2. Suface charge
3. Surface hydrophobicity
4. Ligand Binding

**OR:** Tag engineering

## **Methods**

### **SDS-PAGE**

> **Protein + SDS** -> **Protein Denatured**, and coated with SDS (eliminate charge difference) -> **Immigration speed is determined by molecular weight only**.

### **Western Blot**

Transfer protein bands from ge to a memberane. Immoblize and detected by specific antibody.

### **Chromatography**

Characteristic absorb wavelength of protein: aromatic rings, cystines and disulphide bonds absorb 280nm UV light.

## **Protein Purification Steps**

### **Step1: Collect proteins**

Operations include harvesting cell by centrifugation, lysing cells in a protease inhibitor cocktail, removing cell debris by centrifugation (different rpm).

### **Step2: Capture**

#### Methods: large sample volume, quick-and-dirty, little product loss

- Size exclusion chromatography: Capture proteins basing on their [size (MW) difference](#before-purification)

- Ion exchange chromatography: Capture proteins basing on their [different surface charge](#before-purification).

- [Hydrophobic chromatography](#before-purification)

>利用蛋白质的疏水性，蛋白经变性处理或处于高盐环境下疏水残基会暴露于蛋白表面，不同蛋白疏水残基与固定相的疏水性配体之间的作用强弱不同，依次用从高至低离子强度洗脱液可将疏水用作由弱至强的组分分离。

- [Affinity chromatography](#before-purification): Target proteins, or engineered target proteins, bind to stationary phase covalently. e.g. IMAC[^1] (imobilised metal ion chromatography) is used to capture histidine, cystine, or tryptophan rich proteins. One often used peptide sequence in IMAC is 6-His tag.

### **Step3: Intermediate step** (remove contaminants)

- Aiming to remove **bulk** contaminants.

- Suitable methods include *ion exchange chromatography* (IEC) and *hydrophobic interaction chromatography* (HIC)

### **Step4: Polishing** (something like refinement? remove contaminants too)

- Aiming to remove **difficult** contaminants, such as protein aggregates of the target protein.

- Methods include **SEC** for aggregates of the target protein and high resolution **IEC** for impurities with similar size.

> **one problem in quiz is shown below:**
> Above is an illustration of the X-ray structure of C-reactive protein (CRP). It is a plasma protein that exists in vivo as a pentameric disc consistent with the X-ray structure. Each subunit of CRP has a molecular weight of 25 kDa. During a purification of CRP you will use SEC as the polishing step and SDS-PAGE to analyse the peaks. Both SEC and SDS-PAGE give an estimate of molecular weight. What molecular weights would you expect for SEC and SDS-PAGE?
> Select one or more:
> a.SEC: 25 kDa,  SDS-PAGE: 25 kDa.
> b.SEC: 125 kDa,  SDS-PAGE: 25 kDa.
> c.SEC: 125 kDa, SDS-PAGE: 125 kDa
> d.SEC: 25 kDa, SDS-PAGE: 125 kDa
> e.SEC: 50 kDa, SDS-PAGE: 25 kDa

The correct answer is only `b`, but I thought option `e` should be included, given that subunit dimer, which have a different molecular weight, may also present after SEC.

[^1]: A workflow of the IMAC capture is shown below: **Tag engineering**: Add a 6-His tag on the target protein, along with a TEV cleavage sequence (so that this tag can be removed through TEV, which is very sepecific, easily) -> **IMAC capture** -> **Remove 6-His tag** -> Recover free target protein, with tag binded protein being retained on the stationary phase.
